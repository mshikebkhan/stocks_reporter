This is a simple python project that sends you an SMS alert when the stock price faces a rise or fall of 5% or more.
I have used Twelve Data API to get stock prices of the last 2 days
and News Api Org for getting news headlines about the stock company so that you get an idea of why this stock price rose or fell.
Please do signup in the both websites those are free and get your API key.

*Note: As the stock market remains closed on weekends you may face errors (I will fix it soon I am feeling lazy :)
**Note: You can host this script on python anywhere to run it automatically.
