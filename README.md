This is a simple python project which sends you a SMS alert when stock price face a rise or fall of 5% or more.
I have used Twelve Data api for getting stocks price of last 2 days
and News Api Org for getting news headlines about the stock company so that you get an idea why this stock price rised or fell.
Please do signup in the both websites those are free and get your api key.

**Note: You can host this script on pythonanywhere for running it automatically
